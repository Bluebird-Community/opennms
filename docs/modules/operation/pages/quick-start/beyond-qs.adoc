= Beyond the Quick Start Guide

After you have finished following the steps in the Quick Start guide, your {page-component-title} instance should be set up and monitoring your network.

Of course, there is still much more that you can do to customize {page-component-title} to suit your needs.
You can explore the Deep Dive section to learn more.

The following sections include suggested topics that supplement the Quick Start guide.

== User management

We covered creating and setting up an admin user account in xref:operation:quick-start/users.adoc[Step 1: First-Time Login].
You may want to create and set up additional user accounts with different permissions.
These topics expand on those covered in the Quick Start guide:

* xref:operation:deep-dive/user-management/user-config.adoc[Create users] and xref:operation:deep-dive/user-management/security-roles.adoc[assign permissions].
* xref:operation:deep-dive/user-management/user-groups.adoc[Create and maintain user groups].
* xref:operation:deep-dive/user-management/user-oncall.adoc[Define on-call roles and schedules].

== Provision inventory

We covered initial inventory provisioning in xref:operation:quick-start/inventory.adoc[Step 3: Provision Inventory].
You may want to provision new nodes and iterate on the work that you did in the Quick Start guide.
These topics serve as starting points for more information:

* xref:operation:deep-dive/provisioning/auto-discovery.adoc[Set up auto discovery].
* xref:operation:deep-dive/provisioning/directed-discovery.adoc[Set up directed discovery].
* xref:operation:deep-dive/provisioning/foreign-source.adoc[Define a foreign source].

== Performance management

In xref:operation:quick-start/performance-data.adoc[Step 4: Set Up Performance Data Collection], we covered how to set up your {page-component-title} environment for basic performance data collection.
You may want to collect more data to help you better understand what is happening in your network and create more representative visualizations.
You can look through these topics to learn more:

* xref:operation:deep-dive/performance-data-collection/data-types.adoc[Learn about data types].
* xref:operation:deep-dive/performance-data-collection/resource-types.adoc[Learn about resource types].
* xref:operation:deep-dive/performance-data-collection/snmp-index.adoc[Create custom resource types].

== Thresholding

xref:operation:quick-start/thresholding.adoc[Step 5: Set up a Threshold] covered how to set up event thresholds in your {page-component-title} instance.
For more information and concepts that extend the Quick Start guide, see the following pages:

* xref:operation:deep-dive/thresholds/datasource.adoc[Thresholding tasks].
* xref:operation:deep-dive/thresholds/thresh-group.adoc[Create threshold groups].
* xref:operation:deep-dive/thresholds/troubleshoot.adoc[Manage and troubleshoot thresholds].

== Service availability

In xref:operation:quick-start/service-assurance.adoc[Step 7: Determine Service Availability], we covered how to track the availability of your services with pollerd.
The following topics are starting points for establishing more complex monitoring environments:

* xref:operation:deep-dive/service-assurance/configuration.adoc[Configure and modify pollerd behavior].
* xref:operation:deep-dive/service-assurance/polling-packages.adoc[Group service configurations into polling packages].
* xref:operation:deep-dive/service-assurance/path-outages.adoc[Set up path outages].
* xref:operation:deep-dive/service-assurance/downtime-model.adoc[Detect short service outages with downtime models].

== Notifications

We covered how to configure notifications in xref:operation:quick-start/notifications.adoc[Step 2: Turn on Default Notifications] and xref:operation:quick-start/notification-config.adoc[Step 8: Configure Notifications].
Beyond that, you can review the xref:operation:deep-dive/notifications/bonus-strategies.adoc[bonus notification strategies] to set up routing to Slack and Mattermost.

== Customize {page-component-title} home page

We covered visualizations in xref:operation:quick-start/visualize-data.adoc[Step 9: Visualize Data], but you can do much more to display your data--including customizing your {page-component-title} home page.
For more information, see xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/webui/grafana-dashboard-box.adoc[Grafana Dashboard Box] in the Deep Dive section.

== Explore the Deep Dive section

To learn more about any of the topics covered in the Quick Start guide, you can explore their corresponding documentation in the xref:deep-dive/introduction.adoc[Deep Dive] section.
Deep Dive topics are referenced in each of the Quick Start pages; they can provide a starting point.

== Explore the Reference section

The Reference section provides information on {page-component-title} collectors, service monitors, and daemons.
This includes details on configuration settings and files, as well as parameters associated with the components.
