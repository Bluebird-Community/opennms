= Deploy {page-component-title} in a Containerized Environment
:description: Learn how to install OpenNMS Horizon/Meridian in a containerized environment like Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift.

If your organization uses Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift, OpenNMS makes a Helm chart available to simplify {page-component-title} deployment.

Each deployment through Helm charts has a single Core server, Grafana, a custom Ingress that shares the RRD files and some configuration files, and multiple Sentinels for flow processing.

This section describes the configuration parameters and information you will need to install {page-component-title}.

The OpenNMS Helm Chart is based and tested against the latest {page-component-title}.
The minimum versions available are Horizon 32.x and Meridian 2023.x.
