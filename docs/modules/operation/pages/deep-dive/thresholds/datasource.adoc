= Thresholding Tasks
:description: Thresholding tasks in {page-component-title}: use metadata, confirm you are collecting metrics, and determine the data source.

For information on how to create a basic or expression-based threshold, see xref:quick-start/thresholding.adoc[] in the Quick Start section.
This section describes related thresholding tasks.

[[ga-threshold-metadata]]
== Use metadata in a threshold

Metadata in expression-based thresholds can streamline threshold creation.
The <<deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl, Metadata DSL>> (domain specific language) lets you use patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.
A single expression can behave differently based on the node that it is tested against.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata
* Service metadata

Metadata is also supported in the value, re-arm, and trigger fields for Single-DS and expression-based thresholds.
For more information on metadata and how to define it, see <<deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#metadata-overview, Metadata>>.

=== Example

This procedure uses metadata to trigger an event when the number of logged-in users exceeds one.
The expression is in the form `${context:key|context_fallback:key_fallback|...|default}`.

Before using metadata in a threshold, you need to add the metadata context pairâ€”-in this case, a requisition key called `userLimit` (see <<deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#ga-metadata-webui, Adding metadata through the web UI>>).

Follow these steps to create the expression-based threshold:

. Click the *gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen.
. Under Performance Measurement, click *Configure Thresholds*.
. Click *Edit* beside the `netsnmp` group.
. Click *Create New Expression-based Threshold*.
. Fill in the following information:
+
* Type: High
* Expression: `hrSystemNumUsers / ${requisition:userLimit|1}`
* Datasource type: Node
* Value: 1
* Rearm: 1
* Description: Too many logged-in users
+

. Click *Save*.

This expression will trigger an event when the number of logged-in users exceeds one.

== Confirm that you are collecting metrics

Before creating a threshold, you should make sure that you are collecting the metric against which you want to threshold:

. Choose menu:Reports[Resource Graphs].
. Select one of the listed resources.
. Under SNMP Node Data, select menu:Node-Level Performance Data[Graph Selection].
. Scroll to find the graph for the metric you want to threshold.
+
You can click the *binoculars* symbol to display only that graph.

[[datasource-determine]]
== Determine the data source

Creating a threshold requires the name of the data source generating the metrics on which you want to threshold.
Data source names for the SNMP protocol appear in `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d`.

To determine the name of the data source, navigate to the *Resource Graphs* screen:

. Choose menu:Reports[Resource Graphs].
. Select one of the listed resources.
. Under SNMP Node Data, select menu:Node-Level Performance Data[Graph Selection].
. Scroll through the graphs to find the title of the graph that displays the metric on which you want to threshold.
For example, "Number of Processes" or "System Uptime":
+
.{page-component-title} performance data metric graphs
image::thresholding/Graphs.png["Two example performance data metric graphs: one displays system uptime, and one displays the number of active processes over time"]

. Go to `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d` and search for the title of the graph (for example, "System Uptime").
. Note the name of the data source (found as *columns* for the graph report properties), and type it in the *Datasource* box when you xref:quick-start/thresholding.adoc[create your threshold].

[[thresholding-response-times]]
== Thresholding on response times from polled services

To leverage response times from polled services as part of a threshold, you must ensure that the service has thresholding enabled by setting a parameter in the `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/pollerd-configuration.xml` file.

As an example, the following configuration for the HTTP service will enable thresholding by setting the `thresholding-enabled` parameter to true:

[source, xml]
-----

      <service name="HTTP" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on">
         <parameter key="retry" value="${requisition:poller-retry|requisition:retry|detector:retry|1}" />
         <parameter key="timeout" value="${requisition:poller-timeout|requisition:timeout|detector:timeout|3000}" />
         <parameter key="port" value="${requisition:port|detector:port|80}" />
         <parameter key="url" value="${requisition:url|detector:url|/}" />
         <parameter key="rrd-repository" value="/opt/opennms/share/rrd/response" />
         <parameter key="rrd-base-name" value="http" />
         <parameter key="ds-name" value="http" />
         <parameter key="thresholding-enabled" value="true"/>
      </service>
-----

The `rrdRepository` attribute of the thresholding group in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/thresholds.xml` must contain the appropriate path to the `response` repository.  In the the example below, the path is `/opt/opennms/share/rrd/response`.

Additionally, response time thresholds must be `interface` (`if`) type.
Below is an example section from `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/thresholds.xml`:

[source, xml]
-----
   <group name="high-network-latency" rrdRepository="/opt/opennms/share/rrd/response/">
      <threshold description="High Latency for Interface" type="high" ds-type="if" value="1000" rearm="200" trigger="3" filterOperator="OR" ds-name="http"/>
   </group>
-----

To complete the example, the thresholding package definition from `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/threshd-configuration.xml` :

[source, xml]
-----
   <package name="iot-network-latency">
      <filter>IPADDR != '0.0.0.0' </filter>
      <include-range begin="1.1.1.1" end="254.254.254.254"/>
      <include-range begin="::1" end="ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff"/>
      <service name="HTTP" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on">
         <parameter key="thresholding-group" value="high-network-latency"/>
      </service>
   </package>
