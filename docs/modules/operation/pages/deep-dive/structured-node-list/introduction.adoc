:description: Provides details about the Structured Node List of {page-component-title}.

The {page-component-title} 33 Web UI includes a new feature, the Structured Node List.
This is a Vue-based page which displays node information and enables the user to perform enhanced data display, searching, filtering, and data export.

Navigate to this page from the main menu `Info > Structured Node List`.

The main display shows a paginated table of nodes corresponding to the current search and filtering parameters.
Most of the columns can be sorted in ascending or descending order.

You can choose between 10, 20 or 50 entries per page, and can navigate between pages, or go to the start or end of the currently filtered set.

.Structured Node List

The first column of each node has an Action menu where the user can:

- choose various actions, including "Info..." to open a dialog window displaying details about the node
- navigate to various relevant pages (Alarms, Events, etc.)
- perform other actions (Rescan, Schedule an Outage, etc.)

Above the table is a button that allows you to export the current data in either CSV or JSON format.

A gear icon opens the Node Preferences window which allows you to configure which columns are displayed and in which order.
Saving this configuration will also save the current search and filtering options.

An input field above the table allows you to search by node label.

On the left is the Filtering and Extended Search panel which allows you to filter and search by various parameters.

== Node Table

The table displays various columns of information about the nodes that match the current search and filter parameters.

The Node Label and ID fields contain links to navigate to the Node Details page.

The IP Address field contains a link to go to the IP Interface page for that interface.
A tooltip will also display more information about the interface, for example if it is Managed, Primary, Not Eligible, etc.

The Flows field contains arrows denoting whether Ingress and/or Egress flow information is available, and a tooltip provides more detail.

== Action Menu

The Action Menu next to each node contains the following:

Click "Default" to reset all displayed columns to the default list visibility and order.

Click the checkbox next to each column to display or hide that column. Note that changes take effect immediately.

Click the up and down arrows to reorder the columns.

This will also save your current search and filtering configuration.

Click the "X" to close without making changes.

NOTE: Node Preferences are stored in your browser's `Local Storage`.
This will retain the information in that browser for that machine's current user, which may or may not be the OpenNMS user you are logged in as.
The preferences will be retained unless cleared by your browser's policy.
Note that currently your preferences won't be available on different machines or the same machine using a different web browser.

== Filtering and Searching

Filtering and searching can be done via the Filtering and Extended Search sections in the left panel, and by the "Search node label" search box above the node table.
Note that searches will combine the results of *all* configured filters and search parameters.
For example you can search by `Category + Location + Extended Search Term + Node Label search term` in any combination.

=== Node Label Search

The input box above the Node Table allows you to search by node label.
Note, this is a case-sensitive wildcard search.
Entering `cal` will match nodes have the label `localhost` as well as `california` but not `California`.

=== Filtering

Filtering allows you to filter by Category (i.e. Surveillance Category), Flows and Monitoring Locations.

Click on an item to filter by that item.
More than one item per section can be selected.
As items are selected, the number of items selected will display; a check icon will display to clear that section's selections.

Use "Clear All" to clear all filters and search parameters.

The Categories section allows you to enable "Match All", in which case only nodes corresponding to *all* the selected categories (i.e. the "intersection") will be displayed.
For example, you could filter on nodes that are in both the *Routers* and *Production* categories.

Note that some fields perform wildcard searches and some are exact searches.
Also note that some fields, for example SNMP fields, are not displayed in the table, but will display in the Node Details dialog.
