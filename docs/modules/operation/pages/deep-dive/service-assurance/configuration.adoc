= Configure Pollerd

For information on configuration and log files related to pollerd, see xref:reference:daemons/daemon-config-files/pollerd.adoc[] in the reference section.

You can modify `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/poller-configuration.xml` to change the behavior for service monitoring.
The configuration file has the following parts:

* Global daemon configuration:
** Define the thread pool size used to run service monitors in parallel.
** Define and configure the critical service for node event correlation.
* Polling packages:
** Package to group service monitor configuration parameters.
* Downtime Model:
** Configure pollerd behavior to run tests if an outage is detected.
* Monitor service association:
** Implement application or network management protocol assignments.
This configures settings for individual services, based on their names.

.Global configuration parameters for pollerd
[source, xml]
----
<poller-configuration threads="30" <1>
                      pathOutageEnabled="false" <2>
                      serviceUnresponsiveEnabled="false"> <3>
----

<1> Size of the thread pool.
This lets service monitors run in parallel.
<2> Enable or disable path outage functionality based on a critical node in a network path.
<3> In case of an unresponsive service, generate a `serviceUnresponsive` event instead of an outage.
This stops the xref:operation:deep-dive/service-assurance/downtime-model.adoc[Downtime Model] from retesting the service after 30 seconds, and prevents false alarms.

Restart {page-component-title} and pollerd to apply configuration changes.
You can also reload the configuration to send an event to pollerd.
You can send an event using the CLI or the web UI.

.Send `configuration-reload` event via CLI
[source, shell]
----
cd $OPENNMS_HOME/bin
./send-event.pl uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig --parm 'daemonName Pollerd'
----

The following shows settings to configure a reload event in the UI:

== Metadata DSL

The <<deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl, Metadata DSL>> (domain specific language) lets you use dynamic configuration in parameter values to interpolate metadata into the parameter.
The syntax lets you use patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata
* Service metadata

[[ga-pollerd-configuration-async]]
== Asynchronous engine

By default, the number of polls active at any given time is limited by the number of threads that are allocated to the daemon.
Each thread is responsible for one poll, and will block until the poll is completed.
This is true, even when the polling is done by a Minion at a remote location.
In this case, the thread will block for the duration of the RPC.

In scenarios where there are hundreds of different locations, and hundreds of nodes at each of these, it can be desirable to reduce the number of threads required on the core.
Each thread allocates a fixed amount of system memory, and too many threads active at a given time can extraneous load on the system due to context switching.

For these reasons, we have developed a new asynchronous mode for the poller.
When enabled, threads are released while the polls are active, allowing Minions to process more polls than there are threads.

To enable the feature, set the following attributes in the top level element of `etc/poller-configuration.xml`:
[source, xml]
----
<poller-configuration threads="30"
                      asyncPollingEngineEnabled="true" <1>
                      maxConcurrentAsyncPolls="200" <2>
----

<1> Enable the asynchronous engine.
<2> Used to limit the number of polls active, since each of these still consume some memory resources.

In this mode, threads are only used to trigger the execution of the poll, so the number can be typically reduced.
The actual number of polls active, or in-flight, can be observed via the `NumPollsInFlight` metrics associated with the daemon's MBeans.
