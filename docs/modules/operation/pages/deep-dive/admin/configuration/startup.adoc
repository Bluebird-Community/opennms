= Startup Configuration

There are a number of startup settings that you can configure, including `JAVA_HEAP_SIZE`.
{page-component-title} startup scripts load `\${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.conf` early in their startup, if that file exists.

No `opennms.conf` exists in the default RPM/DEB installation, but `\${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/examples` includes a sample file that you can use as a starting point.

== Available variables

The most important variables that you might set in `opennms.conf`, include the following:

`JAVA_HEAP_SIZE` and `JAVA_INITIAL_HEAP_SIZE` (units are in MB; suffix m added automatically with result passed as `-Xmx` and `-Xms` flag to JVM, respectively)

`ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS` (appended to other JVM startup flags)

`MAXIMUM_FILE_DESCRIPTORS` (passed to `ulimit -n` before starting JVM)

`MAXIMUM_SIZE_STACK_SEGMENT` (passed to `ulimit -s` before starting JVM)
